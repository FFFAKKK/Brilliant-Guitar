# Core Kernel Guidelines

> **Current staged workflow (2026-07-15):** Each task implements one approved
> mechanism block. K1-2 now owns commands/transactions/history/replay only.

For K1-2, read `backend/score-document-model.md`, `backend/command-transaction.md`, and all staged boundary/diagnostic/quality guides. The K1-1 model and validation contracts remain frozen. K1-2 does not implement snapshots/events, registry/capability, general reports, migrations, Guitar Domain, UI, playback, or physical IO.

The K1-1 data path is `unknown -> decode -> semantic validation -> ScoreFeatureProfile`. Unknown extension data must survive semantic round-trip.

> Entry point for Pure Core Kernel V1 development in this single-repo Trellis workspace.

## Scope

Use this layer when implementing or reviewing the pure TypeScript Core Kernel.

The detailed rules live under `backend/` because the kernel is a non-UI, non-desktop-shell, domain/backend layer even though the eventual product is a desktop app.

## Pre-Development Checklist

- [ ] Confirm the task is still scoped to `Pure Core Kernel V1 only`.
- [ ] Read [Backend Core Kernel Guidelines](./backend/index.md).
- [ ] Read the shared [Long-Term Maintenance Guide](../guides/long-term-maintenance-guide.md).
- [ ] Confirm the change does not introduce UI, Tauri, VexFlow, Web Audio, PDF/PNG, Guitar Pro, physical file IO, or third-party plugin runtime behavior.
- [ ] For tasks that expose editable writes, confirm the active K1-2 semantic command/transaction/history boundary.
- [ ] For tasks that expose public reads, confirm snapshot/selector boundaries; K1-1 exposes no read API.

## Quality Check

Before completing Core Kernel work, load `backend/index.md` and apply its full Quality Check section. Do not treat this top-level entry as a substitute for the detailed backend rules.
