# Core Kernel Guidelines

> Entry point for Pure Core Kernel V1 development in this single-repo Trellis workspace.

---

## Scope

Use this layer when implementing or reviewing the pure TypeScript Core Kernel.

The detailed rules live under `backend/` because the kernel is a non-UI, non-desktop-shell, domain/backend layer even though the eventual product is a desktop app.

## Pre-Development Checklist

- [ ] Confirm the task is still scoped to `Pure Core Kernel V1 only`.
- [ ] Read [Backend Core Kernel Guidelines](./backend/index.md).
- [ ] Read the shared [Long-Term Maintenance Guide](../guides/long-term-maintenance-guide.md).
- [ ] Confirm the change does not introduce UI, Tauri, VexFlow, Web Audio, PDF/PNG, Guitar Pro, physical file IO, or third-party plugin runtime behavior.
- [ ] Confirm all score writes flow through semantic commands and kernel transactions.
- [ ] Confirm all score reads flow through snapshots or selectors.

## Quality Check

Before completing Core Kernel work, load `backend/index.md` and apply its full Quality Check section. Do not treat this top-level entry as a substitute for the detailed backend rules.
